# Lesson Summary

The lesson explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance their functionality, such as classification and task automation. It discusses the challenges and strategies of using LLMs with different data formats, emphasizing the importance of using open formats like markdown, txt, json, or yaml for better compatibility and efficiency. The lesson also highlights the need for dynamic data context loading and transformation, as well as the potential benefits of converting data into model-friendly formats to reduce costs and improve processing time. Additionally, it underscores the necessity of verifying access to content and considering data organization, access, and presentation in application development.

## Key Takeaways

- Prompts can guide large language models to extend their knowledge and perform tasks like classification, using both manual and automated data inputs.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows models to automatically incorporate external data, enhancing their generative capabilities.
- Integrating large language models with external data sources offers new possibilities but also presents challenges, such as ensuring correct data access and transformation.
- Open data formats like markdown, txt, json, or yaml are preferable for working with large language models, as they facilitate easier data transformation and access.
- Transforming data into model-friendly formats can reduce token usage, lower costs, and improve processing efficiency, as seen in the conversion from JSON to YAML.
